# Second-order-Distance-learning
Implement the framework proposed in Komodakis, N. (2011, November). Learning to cluster using high order graphical models with latent variables. In 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 73-80). IEEE.

Main is in distance_learning.py and will launch the learning and classification over a synthesized dataset.
